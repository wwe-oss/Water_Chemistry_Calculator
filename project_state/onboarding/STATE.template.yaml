guardrails:
  - "Treat develop branch code as conversation state (do not re-invent)."
  - "Max 2 questions; propose defaults."
  - "No background work; deliver in-message."
  - "Prefer code/JSON; show file paths & commands."
  - "Assumptions explicit; show diffs for changes."
next_steps_expectation:
  - "Produce a 14-line context index (one sentence each)."
  - "Return a repo snapshot (folders & projects)."
  - "Offer two slices: Config System or Engine Logic MVP, with exact files and test plan."
